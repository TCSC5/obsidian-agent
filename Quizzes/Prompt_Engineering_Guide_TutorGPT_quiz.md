# Quiz: Prompt_Engineering_Guide_TutorGPT

- Q: What is the purpose of using API Playground models?  
  - A: To gain transparent control over parameters like temperature, max tokens, and system message configuration.

- Q: Why is reducing prompt length important?  
  - A: It improves accuracy by reducing ambiguity and cognitive load.

- Q: What are the three roles in a prompt?  
  - A: System (persona), user (instruction), and assistant (prior outputs).

- Q: What is one-shot prompting?  
  - A: A technique where a single example is provided before user input to improve performance.

- Q: Why should LLMs avoid fact-dependent tasks?  
  - A: Because they generate content rather than retrieve factual information, which can lead to hallucinations.

- Q: How can you ensure output stability in prompts?  
  - A: By using unambiguous language and specifying format, style, and constraints.

- Q: What is the purpose of testing prompts with data-driven iteration?  
  - A: To ensure prompt success is repeatable and to refine prompt structure based on output quality.
